Hey, I’m Tejdeep an M.S. in Computer Engineering student at NYU Tandon with a passion for building intelligent systems and exploring how technology can solve real-world problems.

I’ve been a tech enthusiast for as long as I can remember — the kid who loved tinkering with gadgets, exploring software, and figuring out how things work. That curiosity eventually grew into a career path in tech.

My B.Tech at IIIT Delhi was nothing short of a rollercoaster ride, packed with experimentation, exploration, and growth. I dove into cybersecurity, machine learning, and open-source development, each giving me new skills and perspectives. It was during this time that I discovered my deep interest in Machine Learning, a field I now explore extensively in my Master’s, from self-supervised learning to large-scale deployment pipelines.

Outside academics, I believe in balance. I play multiple sports, take on leadership roles, and participate in activities that challenge me in different ways. These experiences not only help me relax but often inspire new approaches to problem-solving in my projects.

At my core, I’m someone who never stops at “Do I know this or not?” — I aim to learn as much as I can, as quickly as I can, and bring it to a level where it’s truly usable. For me, every project is a chance to explore, adapt, and grow.
